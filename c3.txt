Java Beans - A reusable software component written in java that can be manipulated visualaly in an application bulder tool.

For example - all GUI Components inherit java.awt.Component class
which means that we can rely on them to have certain standard methods like paint() setSize() etc.
Java Beans are not actually required to inherit a particaular base class or
implement particular interface. But They do provide suport for some or all of the 
following features:-
1.Introduction:- It is a process by which a builder tool analyzes how Beans Work.
	-They adhere  to specific rules called design pattern for naming  bean features
	-Each Bean has realted Bean information class , which provides properly method and event
	-Each Bean information class implements a Bean Info interface,Which explicity lists Bean 
	 features that are to be exposed to application builder tools
2.Properties:-Properties control Beans apperance and Behavior.Builder tools introspect on a Bean to discover its properties and expose them for manipulation . hence we change Beans prorty at design time.
3.customization- expected properties of a bean can be customized at desing time .customization allows users to alter the apperance and behavior of Bean. Bean supports customixation by using special sophicated Bean Customizers.
