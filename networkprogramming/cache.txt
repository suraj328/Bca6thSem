    if(responseCode >= 200 && responseCode < 400){
        inputStream = httpUrlConnection.getInputStream();

    }else{
        inputStream = httpUrlConnection.getErrorStream();
    }
step3:Read the content from input stream and print them to console
    BufferedReader br = BufferedReader(inputStreamReader(inputStream))
    String line = null;
    while((line = br.readLine())!= null)
